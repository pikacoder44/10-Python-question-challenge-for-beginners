# üêç Top 10 Beginner Python Code Challenges

Welcome to the **Top 10 Beginner Python Code Challenges** repository! üöÄ These challenges are designed for those who have a basic understanding of Python and want to sharpen their coding skills.

While these are beginner-level challenges, you'll need to be familiar with the Python programming language to complete them. If you're feeling a bit rusty, check out [Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3) for a beginner-friendly course.

## üõ† How to Get Started

You can solve these challenges locally if you have a development environment set up. If not, feel free to use one of the many online platforms that allow you to execute Python code directly in the browser. And remember, if you get stuck, try to work through the problem before searching for help online. The best learning happens when you challenge yourself! üí™

### Challenge 1: Convert Radians into Degrees
Write a function in Python that accepts one numeric parameter (an angle in radians). The function should convert the radians into degrees and return that value. While there are libraries that can do this for you, try to write the function from scratch. Hint: You'll need to use Pi from Python's `math` module.

### Challenge 2: Sort a List
Create a function that accepts two parameters: a list of numbers and a string (`"asc"`, `"desc"`, or `"none"`). The function should return the list sorted in ascending or descending order based on the string. If the string is `"none"`, return the original list unaltered.

### Challenge 3: Convert a Decimal Number into Binary
Write a function that accepts a decimal number and returns the equivalent binary number. For simplicity, the decimal number will always be less than 1,024, so the binary number will be less than ten digits long.

### Challenge 4: Count the Vowels in a String
Create a function that accepts a single word and returns the number of vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`) in that word. Note that the letter "y" should not be counted as a vowel.

### Challenge 5: Hide the Credit Card Number
Write a function that accepts a credit card number. The function should return a string where all but the last four characters are hidden with asterisks. For example, `4444444444444444` should return `************4444`.

### Challenge 6: Are the Xs Equal to the Os?
Create a function that accepts a string and counts the number of `X`s and `O`s. It should return `True` if the counts are equal and `False` otherwise. If there are no `X`s or `O`s, return `True` (since 0 equals 0).

### Challenge 7: Create a Calculator Function
Write a function that accepts three parameters: two integers and one of the following operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`. The function should perform the specified operation on the integers and return the result. For example, `6 * 4` should return `24`.

### Challenge 8: Give Me the Discount
Create a function that accepts two parameters: the full price of an item and the discount percentage. The function should return the price after the discount is applied. For example, if the price is `100` and the discount is `20%`, the function should return `80`.

### Challenge 9: Just the Numbers
Write a function that accepts a list containing a mix of non-negative integers and strings. The function should return a list containing only the integers, in the same order.

### Challenge 10: Repeat the Characters
Create a function that accepts a string and returns a new string where each character is repeated twice. For example, `"now"` should become `"nnooww"` and `"123a!"` should become `"112233aa!!"`.
